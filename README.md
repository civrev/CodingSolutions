# ProblemSolving

This repository is about me making solutions to coding problems and challenges.
I made 3 attempts to solve this problem. All three perform roughly the same,
with SolutionThree being my best solution.

Files:
- SolutionOne: Solved the problem using HashTable and merge-sort
- SolutionTwo: Solved the problem using HashTable and MaxHeap
- SolutionThree: Solved the problem using HashTable and HashSet array (best attempt)
